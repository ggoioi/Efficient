# EfficientAD Model Implementation
**Model Overview**: The EfficientAD model has been trained to fit our data format and can be used for inference.
**Execution Files**: Use Inference.py and need_module to run the model. This is applicable only for the models that I have trained.
**Training Process**: To train the model, you should use the EfficientAD Small Python file.
**Data Organization**: In the data storage file, create folders to designate each class and insert image files within these folders.
**Current Research**: Currently, we are researching ways to make the EfficientAD model operate faster.
